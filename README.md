# README

Bretzel is a jekyll theme currently being used for our wedding website.  It is
based off of Tim O'Brien's [SinglePaged](http://github.com/t413/SinglePaged),
although much of the css has been converted to sass and changed around,

1. to better suit my needs, and
2. because I needed something to tinker with to learn front-end things!

Feel free to poke around and take what you need.
