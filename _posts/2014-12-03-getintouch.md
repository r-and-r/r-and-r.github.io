# Talk to Us!

###### we don't *usually* bite...

The best way to get in contact with us, especially at this point, is by email.
Send one our way, *via* one of the email addresses below.  It helps if you put
"wedding" or something in the subject line.

We will be putting up information as time goes on, so remember to check back
every so often (*psych!* we'll send you an email or call if it's important) to
learn more about the area, travel, nearby activities, what the heck a Jewish
wedding is, and so on.

Until then!
